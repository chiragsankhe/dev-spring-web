## spring Boot rest API Security 

+ Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework for Java applications, particularly those built with Spring Framework.
+ It is widely used in `enterprise applications ` to `secure web`  and` RESTful APIs`.

### üîê Core Features of Spring Security:
+ `Authentication`  ‚Äì Verifies who the user is (e.g., username/password, OAuth, JWT).

+ `Authorization` ‚Äì Determines what the user is allowed to do (roles, permissions).

+ `Protection against attacks`  ‚Äì Such as CSRF, session fixation, clickjacking.

+ `Password hashing` ‚Äì BCrypt, SCrypt, Argon2 support.

+ `Security for REST APIs` ‚Äì Token-based authentication (like JWT).

+ `Customizable filters`  ‚Äì You can plug in your own security logic easily.

### üß± Basic Components:
+ `SecurityFilterChain` : Intercepts HTTP requests and applies security rules.

+ `UserDetailsService` : Loads user-specific data.

+ `PasswordEncoder`: For encoding and validating passwords.

+ `AuthenticationManager`: Processes authentication requests.

+ `HttpSecurity` : Fluent API to configure web-based security.

###  enable Spring Security in a Spring Boot project, follow these steps:


#### ‚úÖ 1. Add Spring Security Dependency
If you're using Maven, add this to your pom.xml:

```sh
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

‚úÖ 2. Run the Application
Just by adding the dependency, Spring Security gets auto-configured.

+ Default behavior:

+ Secures all endpoints.

+ Exposes a form login page.

Uses an autogenerated password printed in the console.
```sh
Using generated security password: a1b2c3d4...
```
#### ‚úÖ 3. Override Default Security (Optional)
You can customize the security by creating a configuration class:
```sh
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .formLogin(); // enables form login

        return http.build();
    }

    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        UserDetails user = User
            .withUsername("chirag")
            .password(passwordEncoder().encode("1234"))
            .roles("USER")
            .build();

        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user);
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```
####‚úÖ 4. Test the Security
Visit any endpoint like `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser.

You'll be prompted with a login page.

Use the username/password you've configured.
